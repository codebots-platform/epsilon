# Eclipse Epsilon

[Epsilon](https://eclipse.org/epsilon/) is a family of scripting languages and tools for automating common model-based software engineering tasks such as [code generation](https://eclipse.org/epsilon/doc/egl), [model-to-model transformation](https://eclipse.org/epsilon/doc/etl), [model validation](https://eclipse.org/epsilon/doc/evl) and [model visualisation](https://eclipse.org/epsilon/doc/picto), that work out of the box with EMF (including [Xtext](https://www.eclipse.org/Xtext) and [Sirius](https://www.eclipse.org/sirius)), UML (including Cameo/MagicDraw), Simulink, XML and [other types of models](https://eclipse.org/epsilon/doc/emc).

Epsilon can be used as a [standard Java library](https://eclipse.org/epsilon/getting-started/#using-epsilon-as-a-java-library), and also provides [Apache Ant](https://eclipse.org/epsilon/doc/workflow) tasks that can be embedded in [Maven/Gradle builds](https://eclipse.org/epsilon/getting-started/#epsilon-in-mavengradle-builds). Editing support for Epsilon programs is available in [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/epsilon/download), [VS Code](https://eclipse.org/epsilon/doc/articles/vscode) and [Sublime](https://github.com/epsilonlabs/sublime).
